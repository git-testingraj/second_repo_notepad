-: VIEW IN SQL SERVER :-
============================
Q. WHAT IS VIEW?
-> A View in SQL is just a saved SQL Query.
-> A view can also be considered as virtual table.
-> A view does not contain any data
-> The fields in view as fields from one or more table in the database
-> You can add SQL functions, WHERE and JOIN statement to view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How to create VIEW?
It can be create by DDL statement.
A view can be created for one or multiple table.

SYNTAX: CREATE VIEW < VIEWNAME >
	AS
 	<QUERY>

EX.	create view empview
	as
	select * from employee
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How to create view for multiple table 
ANS:
	create view multiview
	as
	select * from employee E JOIN department D ON E.dept_id = D.dept_id

	select * from multiview;

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How to retriew or fetch view ?
we have already created view with name of ' empview ' as mentioned above.
so now we have to write simple query for view

[ Select * from empview ]

--------------------------------------------------------------
Q. HOW to see / check defination of view or script of view ?
If we want to see script of view then we have to use following syntax

SYNTANX: Exec Sp_helptext < viewname >

example:  exec sp_helptext empview;

--------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How to update the metadata of a SQL VIEW ?
Suppose we add one another column into employee table that will contain NULL values
and then if we execute to VIEW which is already created 
then new added column will not reflect in view

follow step for understand
step 1: for check employee table data
Select * from employee ;

step 2: now we create view
create view metaview
as
select * from employee ;

step 3: lets check to view, now all data from employee table will display into view
select * from metaview;

step 4: now we add one column into main table
ALTER table employee add pincode INT ;

so new added column will display into employee table but in VIEW it will not reflect,
thats why we need to refresh VIEW 

step 5: Refresh to created view using this statement

Exec Sp_refreshview metaview ;

step 6: now execute to view and see new added column will be display.
Select * from metaview ;

----------------------------------------------------------
Q. HOW TO CREATE SCHEMA BINDING IN SQL VIEW/ How to create secure columns by using view ?
Once we create SCHEMA BINDING to column in view then we can not drop or delete one or more column from main table
also you can not ALTER any column .

SYNTAX:  Create view < view_name >
	 With schemabinding
	 as
	< here write query and select which column you does not want to delete>

example:  create view schemabindview
	  With schemabinding
	  as
	  select * from dbo.employee;
		
			OR
	create view schemabindview
	WITH SCHEMABINDING
	as
	select emp_name,emp_city, emp_department from DBO.Employee;

	select * from schemabindview ;

now if you delete any one column from main table and then it will show error.

	alter table employee drop column city;

If you change column name then it will also display error

	SP_RENAME 'employee.city','employee.city_name' ;

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. WHY TO USE VIEW?

HIDE THE COMPLEXITY OF QUERY
-> COLUMN LEVEL SECURITY
-> ROW LEVEL SECURITY
ANS:
Suppose we have a complex query and we don't want to write this complex query again and again 
then we will create view for easily access this query.

ROW LEVEL SECURITY:- using this query user only can access data which emp_id is greater than proving condition

	create view rowview
	as
	select * from employee where emp_id > 5;

COLUMN LEVEL SECURITY:- Using this we can hide column and display those column which we want into view

	create view colview
	as
	select emp_name , emp_city , emp_department from employee ; 

	select * from colview ;

----------------------------------------------------------------------
		APPLY VIEW ON DML STATEMENT
		===========================
There are few conditions for DML commands in VIEW: 

		1. we can use DML operation on a single table only
		2. View should not contain GROUP BY, HAVING ,DISTINCT CLAUSES
		3. We can not use a SUBQUERY in a VIEW in SQL SERVER.
		4. We can not SET operations in a SQL VIEW.

1. INSERT INTO VIEW: we will insert data into view 
	
	Create view insertview
	as
	select * from employee;
	
	select * from insertview;

	Insert into insertview (emp_name, emp_city,emp_department) values ('Durgesh','Nagpur','IT');

now data has been inserted into view as well as main table.

2. DELETE FROM VIEW:
we have already create a view so

query:-   Delete from insertview where emp_id=5;

lets check to view and main table data whether delete operation is successfull or not

	select * from employee;
	select * from insertview;

3. UPDATING VIEW:-
	Suppose we want to update data/record into table with view then we can do using DML stm.
   (Note: i'm taking same view which is create for insert data)

		update insertview set city='Nagpur' where emp_id=10;

(Now i will compare both table data)
	select * from employee;
	select * from insertview;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

			CREATE VIEW ' WITH CHECK OPTION '
			=================================
The WITH CHECK CLAUSE is used to prevent the insertion of rows in the view 
where the condition in the WHERE CLAUSE in create view stm is not satisfied.
when we give a condition and if condition is satisfied then data will inserted otherwise it will show error.
It is just like a security.

example: 	Create view checkviewoptionn
		as
		select * from employee where city='Pune';
		WITH CHECK OPTION;

	SELECT * FROM checkviewoption ; 
now if insert data through view and insert other city name which is different from given conditon then it will show error, lets check it

	Insert into checkviewoption (emp_name, emp_department, emp_city) values ('Rohit','Manager','Nagpur');   ----it will display error 
	Insert into checkviewoption (emp_name, emp_department, emp_city) values ('Rohit','Manager','Pune');     -----this data will insert because here city condition is satisfied.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. HOW TO RENAME A VIEW ?
syntax:	  sp_rename 'old_name','new_name';
example:  sp_rename 'viewemp','viewemp1';

-------------------------------------------------
FOR ALTER VIEW:
suppose we create a view like

	Create view alterview
	as
	select * from employee;

now i want only specific column in that view ,so in this condition we will ALTER to view.

	ALTER view atlerview
	as
	select emp_name, emp_city, emp_department from employee;

	select * from alterview;

---------------------------------------------------
Q. HOW TO DROP VIEW
Syntax:    Drop view <view_name>;

example:   Drop view alterview;
